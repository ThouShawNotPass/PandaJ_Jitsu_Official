# TODO's

# Critical
- Rewrite all classes and comments with DartDoc formatting (tray, frame, dojo, deck, card).
- Convert stray numbers to static const values.


- Scale the tray based on screen width (including numerical padding adjustments).

# Features
- Rename Dojo class to Background (so we can have several different background locations, some that are not in a dojo).
